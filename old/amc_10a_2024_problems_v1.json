We square, rearrange, and apply the difference of squares formula to the given equation: It is clear that so Each ordered pair gives one ordered pair so there are such ordered pairs Remark From we get respectively. ~MRENTHUSIASM Squaring both sides of the given equation gives Splitting into its factors (keep in mind it doesn't ask for positive integers, so the factors can be double negative, too) gives six cases:      . Note that the square root in the problem doesn't have with it. Therefore, if there are two solutions, and , then these together are to be counted as one solution.\nThe solutions expressed as are:      . and are to be counted as one, same for and . Therefore, the solution is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 From looking at the problem, it's obvious that are already solutions. From squaring and rearranging, we get We know that the difference between two consecutive squares is always odd, and for each pair of increasing consecutive squares, the difference starts from and increases by each time. This means that there is an existing pair, of consecutive squares that will satisfy this equation. Also note that the answer cannot be infinity because the difference between two squares will increase as the two squares get higher, consecutive or not. Therefore, the solutions and where and are consecutive that have a square difference of , give the answer of ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Minor Note: Looking at the problem, it is obvious of -7 and 7 as solutions and you can eliminate 1,3,and infinite. You can assume that there is more than 2 solutions because when determining square expressions, these problems usually always have more than an obvious solution.\n~breakingbread Clearly, and are solutions.\nNotice that . Remembering our Pythagorean triples, we realize is a solution as well, and by extension, so is . Since 7 is not part of any other Pythagorean triple, we can conclude the answer is .\n~i_am_suk_at_math_2 Since in there are no restrictions of the sign of , we know that the solution will come in pairs, with negative and positive . Therefore, the answer will not be or . We can further confirm that it is not , since the problem would probably ask for an operation of and instead of the number of solutions. We can also guess it is not , since then the problem would ask for the sum of one of the variables in the solutions. It seems improbable that over the integers there would be infinite answers. So the answer is ~megaboy6679 (do not ever use this) Rearranging the equation gives  This is a classic Pythagorean Theorem equation, where is a leg and and are the two remaining legs. All we have to do is to find triples that satisfy this equation. It is common knowledge that is a triple, thus and are two solutions. Another one is , so and are two other solutions. We can be sure that there are no other triples to find because is the highest answer choice, otherwise it would be \"infinitely many\", which isn't plausible.

This pair isn't commute. and . . gives the point , while the other way gives . Not a valid pair and . ends in the point , and also ends in . This pair works. and . gives the point , and going the other way also ends in . This pair is valid. Therefore, the answer is . Note: It is easier to just visualize this problem instead of actually calculating points on paper. ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Label the transformations as follows: • a translation units to the right • a -rotation counterclockwise about the origin • a reflection across the -axis • a dilation centered at the origin with scale factor Now, we count each transformation individually. It is not hard to see that and are commutative (an easy way to test commutativity for some cases would be to have the original point on the -axis). In total, transformation pairs commute. ~xHypotenuse Alright so realize that obviously rotation and dilation are commute, if you ever looked at the polar plane. Also, reflecting around the x-axis means that moving to the right two units and dilating are commute. You can easily see this by taking an arbitrary point and applying the transformations. The rest don’t work since you can easily test out using random points on the plane, which means the answer is . ~EaZ_Shadow https://youtu.be/ABkKz0gS1MU?si=ZQBgDMRaJmMPSSMM https://youtu.be/QVDbm5sDxxU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

However, since the area in this configuration is simply we can infer that the problem is talking about the configuration in Solution 1. ~dbnl Since this problem involves equilateral triangles, the only possible number under the square root is .

This will make an equilateral triangle of side length 24. if you look now, the area within the equilateral triangle consists of 3 of a circle, and 3 of x. we first find the area of the triangle, which is , we then find the area of of a circle, which is , we subtract by , and divide by 3, yielding the area of x. _________________________________________ = is which is ~Yiguo Zhang https://youtu.be/rIF5L_-zZYQ https://youtu.be/ABkKz0gS1MU?si=ZQBgDMRaJmMPSSMM https://youtu.be/oCQ_QvXqV5s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzXBMltyXjs&t=53s The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

The side opposite on the large rectangle is hence written as . However, can be written as . Since the two lengths are equal, we can write , or . Therefore, we can write .

Team A has a chance of winning at home, and its probability of winning when playing away from home is . Outcomes of the games are independent. The probability that Team A wins the playoff is .

Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for , where itself and are factors of . From here, we can check whether yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of , which is . , this doesn't have an integer root either.

This means that there will be or whole loops in the subset implying that there will be elements in S. However, we have undercounted, as we did not count the remainder that resulted from With a remainder of we can fit more elements into the subset namely and resulting in a total of or elements in subset . NOTE: To prove that this is the best we can do, consider adding each element one by one, for the first element, say n. If n is greater than 2, we can choose n - 2 which is always better. Therefore, n = 1 or n = 2. If n = 2 was optimal, then choose it, then the set of usable numbers in becomes 5 through 2024. We can transform the usable set of to where contains the numbers 1 through 2020. Because we assumed n = 2 was optimal, we can choose n = 2 for the set too. Because every element in is 4 below the elements of , choosing 2 in would mean choosing 6 in set . By induction we see that our list would be {2,6,10,14,18,.....2022} which only gives 506 elements which is sub-optimal. Therefore, we can conclude that n = 1 is optimal, and we proceed as the solution above. -weihou0 Notice that we can first place odd numbers, then place even numbers between each pair. We can start at and continue from there. Realize that the smallest number such that reproduces odd number is . The next ones are . We can proceed to find the number of numbers in this particular sequence. From the equation , we get that works, so this means there is 253 solutions. Looking at we can see that there could only be 1 possible number between each pair, yielding . Then see that we can fit two more into the number count since the set to can fit two evens. Now this means and don’t work. Now test out . Using the same method, we get that is the maximum number in the set. Everything above doesn’t work, as we can split it down into smaller subgroups, so the answer is . ~EaZ_Shadow  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ0SBMqeAfg https://youtu.be/fW7OGWee31c?si=oq7toGPh2QaksLHE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

We fill this in: Looking at the second row, has two values beside it, so we can write and we can do the same with the third row, which gives Now we have the system of equations and solving it gives , therefore we can now fill in the grid with actual numbers. But before doing that, note that we're only looking for a value in the first row, and because we already have two known values in that row, we can find the common difference for that row and not focus on anything else. Focusing only on the first row yields This means that the common difference from right to left is . Therefore, the desired value is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Assume the number in position is .

This means the number is in position (1, 2). The only answer choice that makes an integer is ~ElaineGu Let's look at the bottom-left corner. There can be possible cases for the bottom row. Either the numbers are negative, all , or positive. Let's assume all the numbers are negative. We know that the numbers in between the will be large, so we want to minimize it, because the largest answer choice is only .  To fill in the st and rd column, we simply find the common differences. We get:  Finding the , we notice that it is , which is bigger than any of the other answer choices, so the bottom row can't be negative. (As the common difference for the bottom row gets larger, so does the common difference for the st and rd column, making the bigger, and because the smallest answer is while the minimum value for negative numbers is , it can't be negative.) Now let's assume that all the numbers are 0. By just filling in the st and rd column, we find that it is:  which makes the . is not an answer choice, so the bottom row cannot be all 's. Now, we know that the bottom row must be positive. Here's where the bashing begins. Lucky for us, the numbers must all be integers, cutting down on the number of cases we need to test. Starting with the bottom row having a common difference of , we get  At this point we notice that the second row does not form an arithmetic progression, so we test out the next case, with the common difference being .

What is the area of triangle ?    First, we should find the length of . In order to do this, as we see in the diagram, it can be split into 4 equal sections. Since diagram shows us that it is made up of two triangles, then the triangle outlined in red must be a triangle, as , and the two lines are perpendicular (it is proveable, but during competition, it is best to assume this is true, as the diagram is draw pretty well to scale). Also, since we know the length of the longest side of the red triangle is , then the side we are looking for, which is outlined in blue, must be by the relationship of triangles. Therefore , which is the base of the triangle we are looking, for must be Now all we have to do is find the height. We can split the height into 2 sections, the green and the light green. The green section must be , as shows us. Also, the light green section must be equal to , as in the previous paragraph, the triangle outlined in red is . Then, the green section, which is the height, must be , which is just .

Drawing line splits the triangle into .\nDrawing the altitude from to point on line , we know is , is , and is .

Solving for the area of gives which is ~9897 (latex beginner here) ~i_am_suk_at_math(very minor latex edits) Let's start by looking at kite . We can quickly deduce based off of the side lengths that the kite can be split into two triangles. Going back to the triangle , focus on side . There are kites, they are all either reflected over the line or a line perpendicular to , meaning the length of can be split up into 4 equal parts. Pick out the bottom-left kite, and we can observe that the kite and the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and share a degree angle. (this was deduced from the triangles in the kite) The line AB and the right side of the kite are perpendicular, forming a angle. Because that is also a triangle with a hypotenuse of , so we find the length of AB to be , which is . Then, we can drop an altitude from to . We know that will be equivalent to the sum of the longer side of the kite and the shorter side of the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and . (Look at the line formed on the left of that drops down to if you are confused) We already have those values from the triangles, so we can just plug it into the triangle area formula, .

So, and , and the area is ~Mintylemon66 As stated in the solutions above we can easily find that is split into equal parts, so we have We can calculate by using similarity to find is a triangle, therefore we have and finally therefore Similarly we have is congruent to therefore Next we have is congruent to telling us Noticing is right, we apply Pythagorean theorem to to find Next we would like to calculate CJ, As said before so We know the inscribed angle between CG and GJ is and finally we know So we apply LoC on triangle CGJ in order to find CJ. Now since we have all side lengths of we can find Applying LoC again on we have, We can solve for the area using the sin area formula which is To find we use the well known fact So we find, Finally to wrap up we can find the area of using the sin area formula, Therefore our answer is ~ mathkiddus Assume we set A as . The line AB can be split into 4 equal sections, easily noticed in the picture. Not that the first equal section, starting at A. When we follow the line AB, we see that it's a right angle, noticing its a 30, 60, 90 triangle. Because the hypothenuse of that triangle is . Using the 30, 60, 90 ratio, we see that one of those equal sections is 3/2. Making the coordinate of B, . Now, we must find the coordinate of C. Note that when we drop C down to the perpindicular of AB, there is a component to C, and a component to C. To find the X component, we see that it's one equal section found before as 3/2, and another section equal to 1, given in the question, making it = 5/2. The Y component can be seen as another two sections. The two green sections marked in solution 1. One is due to the same 30 60 90 triangle we found in the first part of the solution. And the other part is , given in the question. Making = . \nSo we see that C = ( , ) Using shoelace theorem, we get to get sorry for no diagrams D: -marcus Alternate way to calculate area: Notice once you get the y-coordinate of C, you can realize it's just the height of the triangle.

However, only the last ordered pair meets all three equations. Therefore, ~ luckuso , megaboy6679 (formatting), Technodoggo (LaTeX optimization/clarity adjustments) Before we start, keep in mind that the problem is asking for the sum \\(ab+bc+ac\\). This is nothing but \\(100+87+60-a-b-c\\), or \\(247-(a+b+c\\)). To solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination: Let's first check options A and B, since they only happen when a,b, and c sum to 35 or 0.\nWe begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, \\( (12, 8, 4) \\) satisfies \\( ab + c = 100 \\), but does not satisfy \\( bc + a = 87\\), or \\( ac + b = 60\\). If \\(a+b+c=0\\), then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work.\nFrom this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be \\( \\textbf{A} \\) or \\( \\textbf{B} \\). Now let's test the next option, option C.\nOption \\( \\textbf{C} \\) states \\( ab + bc + ca = 258 \\). If true, then: \\(a + b + c = -11\\) This sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing \\( (-4, -5, -2) \\) confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option \\( \\textbf{C} \\). Finally, let's test the last two options: D and E.\nFor option \\( \\textbf{E} \\), the sum \\( a + b + c \\) would be: \\(247 - 284 = -37\\) Testing values such as \\( (-11, -12, -14) \\), the resulting sums \\( ab + c \\), \\( bc + a \\), and \\( ac + b \\) are far too large to satisfy the equation.  \nTherefore, \\( \\textbf{E} \\) is also eliminated. Once we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers:\nFinally, we test option \\( \\textbf{D} \\). Using \\( ab + bc + ca = 276 \\), we get that \\(a+b+c = -29\\). Also note that a, b, and c all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of a, b, and c such that they are all different, and the sum \\(a+b+c = -29\\). The values \\( (-9, -12, -8) \\) are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations.\nSo, the correct answer is: ~pimathmonkey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYzBhf3Ke0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://youtu.be/1JyBt8Bh_vI The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

Suppose the bee occupies the point If the die shows , then the bee moves to the point and if the die shows then the bee moves to the point Analogous moves are made with the other four outcomes. Suppose the bee starts at the point and the die is rolled four times. What is the probability that the bee traverses four distinct edges of some unit cube?   ~ Diagram by PaperMath  ~ Solution diagram by juwushu WLOG, assume that the first two moves are equal for all possible combinations, since the direction does not matter. The first move has a probability of being along one of the unit cubes around the origin, and the second move has a chance.\nNow, there are two cases. We are currently on one of the points of the by squares that are aligned with the axes.\nThe first case is if the bee moves to the corner of a cube farthest away from the origin.\nHere, there is a chance of this happening and a chance of the fourth move remaining on one of the cubes.\nThe second case is if the bee moves along the same plane of the by squares previously, ending up on a point 1 away from the origin. There is a chance of this happening and a chance of remaining on one of the cubes.\nNow, multiply and sum for the answer. Evaluating this gives you the answer of .\nSolution by juwushu .\nMinor edits by andliu766 Remove the dice. It is not necessary for this problem. It is the same problem if you instead view this problem as the bee moving one up or down in the and directions. Count the total number of ways for one cube of the 8 total ones. It is not hard to see that after the first step (which you can travel to or -  3 ways), you have a total of 8 moves to traverse a face of that 1x1 cube. Hence, for each cube, you would have total moves. There are a total of 8 cubes you could have traversed, though, so multiplying this by yields We have to account for overcounting. For example, when we traversed the face in the plane the number of ways that we traverse that particular face got counted twice, once from the cube in the far upper right and once from the cube in the closer upper right. For a given face, you can go clockwise or counterclockwise, hence yielding ways. There are a total of shared faces, each one shared by exactly two faces so no additonal PIE is needed. We simply subtract from our original count now, yielding With no restrictions, there are a total of ways to move four steps.

        "problem_statement": "The figure below shows a dotted grid cells wide and cells tall consisting of squares. Carl places -inch toothpicks along some of the sides of the squares to create a closed loop that does not intersect itself. The numbers in the cells indicate the number of sides of that square that are to be covered by toothpicks, and any number of toothpicks are allowed if no number is written. In how many ways can Carl place the toothpicks? Observations: 1. You can not have a vertical line in any place other than the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. 2. You can place a box around the top row or along the bottom row, otherwise all the solutions have a vertical line at the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. Thus, Using casework, we can split this problem into 4 cases. However, we can focus on only the first one for right now. For case 1, we assume that the green lines shown below are given (always have toothpicks on them)   And the only toothpicks we can place that will connect to the red lines are to go horizontally inward:  Now, concentrate on the first row of squares. A toothpick can be placed on either the bottom or top and connected to a continuous squiggle by adding vertical toothpicks, for example,  How many squiggles are possible?  We can summarize this by giving a high squiggle position a 1 and a low position a 0, thus we have a 6-digit binary sequence. Thus, we can have ways to make this squiggle. Case 2: We can also, as the observations state, pull in one of the sides, thus we can have a squiggle with 5 binary digits. only utilizing the first 7 columns:  Here, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 3: Similarly, we can utilize the last 7 columns.  Again, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 4: We can use an even smaller section. Using only the middle 6 columns gives us a 4-wide squiggle:  Thus, there are ways to make this squiggle. Adding up all our cases: However, there are two more ways to draw a qualifying shape:  We can draw a rectangle like that in the first row or third row. Thus, we have a grand total of ways. A note to (potential) editors:\nThis answer was not made to be concise or especially professional. It was made to explicitly explain this problem in a way so that it is easy to understand and follow. ~hermanboxcar5 Notes:\nRemember these are the ONLY possible cases. It is impossible to cross through the rows of boxes of ones to connect the loop around the bottom since then the loop would intersect itself if you are to put only one toothpick on each box with a one (a more clear definition of Observation 1).\nYou are not undercounting by only counting the binary digits on the top, because all of the digits on one side will have corresponding opposite digits on the other. ~juwushu Notice that for any case where the closed loop does not connect from the top side of the ones and bottom side of the ones, there are two of these cases. A cheese solution can be found from this; noting that B and C are the only two options to each other, and, being two apart, with people likely to forget this case, is likely to be the correct answer.\nCheese solution done by juwushu . We have cases where the loop does not go through the middle. If the loop goes through the middle, we must have a full column on Then we have empty middle squares. For each one we can have one on top or one on bottom, so Notice that for each case of fixed toothpicks, there is only one way to form the loop.

We square, rearrange, and apply the difference of squares formula to the given equation: It is clear that so Each ordered pair gives one ordered pair so there are such ordered pairs Remark From we get respectively. ~MRENTHUSIASM Squaring both sides of the given equation gives Splitting into its factors (keep in mind it doesn't ask for positive integers, so the factors can be double negative, too) gives six cases:      . Note that the square root in the problem doesn't have with it. Therefore, if there are two solutions, and , then these together are to be counted as one solution.\nThe solutions expressed as are:      . and are to be counted as one, same for and . Therefore, the solution is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 From looking at the problem, it's obvious that are already solutions. From squaring and rearranging, we get We know that the difference between two consecutive squares is always odd, and for each pair of increasing consecutive squares, the difference starts from and increases by each time. This means that there is an existing pair, of consecutive squares that will satisfy this equation. Also note that the answer cannot be infinity because the difference between two squares will increase as the two squares get higher, consecutive or not. Therefore, the solutions and where and are consecutive that have a square difference of , give the answer of ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Minor Note: Looking at the problem, it is obvious of -7 and 7 as solutions and you can eliminate 1,3,and infinite. You can assume that there is more than 2 solutions because when determining square expressions, these problems usually always have more than an obvious solution.\n~breakingbread Clearly, and are solutions.\nNotice that . Remembering our Pythagorean triples, we realize is a solution as well, and by extension, so is . Since 7 is not part of any other Pythagorean triple, we can conclude the answer is .\n~i_am_suk_at_math_2 Since in there are no restrictions of the sign of , we know that the solution will come in pairs, with negative and positive . Therefore, the answer will not be or . We can further confirm that it is not , since the problem would probably ask for an operation of and instead of the number of solutions. We can also guess it is not , since then the problem would ask for the sum of one of the variables in the solutions. It seems improbable that over the integers there would be infinite answers. So the answer is ~megaboy6679 (do not ever use this) Rearranging the equation gives  This is a classic Pythagorean Theorem equation, where is a leg and and are the two remaining legs. All we have to do is to find triples that satisfy this equation. It is common knowledge that is a triple, thus and are two solutions. Another one is , so and are two other solutions. We can be sure that there are no other triples to find because is the highest answer choice, otherwise it would be \"infinitely many\", which isn't plausible.

It is not hard to see that and are commutative (an easy way to test commutativity for some cases would be to have the original point on the -axis). In total, transformation pairs commute. ~xHypotenuse Alright so realize that obviously rotation and dilation are commute, if you ever looked at the polar plane. Also, reflecting around the x-axis means that moving to the right two units and dilating are commute. You can easily see this by taking an arbitrary point and applying the transformations. The rest don’t work since you can easily test out using random points on the plane, which means the answer is . ~EaZ_Shadow https://youtu.be/ABkKz0gS1MU?si=ZQBgDMRaJmMPSSMM https://youtu.be/QVDbm5sDxxU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

However, since the area in this configuration is simply we can infer that the problem is talking about the configuration in Solution 1. ~dbnl Since this problem involves equilateral triangles, the only possible number under the square root is .

This will make an equilateral triangle of side length 24. if you look now, the area within the equilateral triangle consists of 3 of a circle, and 3 of x. we first find the area of the triangle, which is , we then find the area of of a circle, which is , we subtract by , and divide by 3, yielding the area of x. _________________________________________ = is which is ~Yiguo Zhang https://youtu.be/rIF5L_-zZYQ https://youtu.be/ABkKz0gS1MU?si=ZQBgDMRaJmMPSSMM https://youtu.be/oCQ_QvXqV5s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzXBMltyXjs&t=53s The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

The side opposite on the large rectangle is hence written as . However, can be written as . Since the two lengths are equal, we can write , or . Therefore, we can write .

Team A has a chance of winning at home, and its probability of winning when playing away from home is . Outcomes of the games are independent. The probability that Team A wins the playoff is . Then can be written in the form , where and are positive integers. What is ?  We only have three cases where A wins: AA, ABA, and BAA (A denotes a team A win and B denotes a team B win). Knowing this, we can sum up the probability of each case. Thus the total probability is . Multiplying  both sides by 6 yields , so and we find that .

Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for , where itself and are factors of . From here, we can check whether yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of , which is . , this doesn't have an integer root either.

This means that there will be or whole loops in the subset implying that there will be elements in S. However, we have undercounted, as we did not count the remainder that resulted from With a remainder of we can fit more elements into the subset namely and resulting in a total of or elements in subset . NOTE: To prove that this is the best we can do, consider adding each element one by one, for the first element, say n. If n is greater than 2, we can choose n - 2 which is always better. Therefore, n = 1 or n = 2. If n = 2 was optimal, then choose it, then the set of usable numbers in becomes 5 through 2024. We can transform the usable set of to where contains the numbers 1 through 2020. Because we assumed n = 2 was optimal, we can choose n = 2 for the set too. Because every element in is 4 below the elements of , choosing 2 in would mean choosing 6 in set . By induction we see that our list would be {2,6,10,14,18,.....2022} which only gives 506 elements which is sub-optimal. Therefore, we can conclude that n = 1 is optimal, and we proceed as the solution above. -weihou0 Notice that we can first place odd numbers, then place even numbers between each pair. We can start at and continue from there. Realize that the smallest number such that reproduces odd number is . The next ones are . We can proceed to find the number of numbers in this particular sequence. From the equation , we get that works, so this means there is 253 solutions. Looking at we can see that there could only be 1 possible number between each pair, yielding . Then see that we can fit two more into the number count since the set to can fit two evens. Now this means and don’t work. Now test out . Using the same method, we get that is the maximum number in the set. Everything above doesn’t work, as we can split it down into smaller subgroups, so the answer is . ~EaZ_Shadow  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ0SBMqeAfg https://youtu.be/fW7OGWee31c?si=oq7toGPh2QaksLHE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

Therefore, we have Looking at the third column, we can see that the common difference going up is . We fill this in: Looking at the second row, has two values beside it, so we can write and we can do the same with the third row, which gives Now we have the system of equations and solving it gives , therefore we can now fill in the grid with actual numbers. But before doing that, note that we're only looking for a value in the first row, and because we already have two known values in that row, we can find the common difference for that row and not focus on anything else. Focusing only on the first row yields This means that the common difference from right to left is . Therefore, the desired value is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Assume the number in position is . Then, the integer in position will be , since and average out to x. (They form an arithmetic sequence). Similarly, the integer in position is , and the integer in position is . This means the number is in position (1, 2). The only answer choice that makes an integer is ~ElaineGu Let's look at the bottom-left corner. There can be possible cases for the bottom row. Either the numbers are negative, all , or positive. Let's assume all the numbers are negative. We know that the numbers in between the will be large, so we want to minimize it, because the largest answer choice is only .  To fill in the st and rd column, we simply find the common differences. We get:  Finding the , we notice that it is , which is bigger than any of the other answer choices, so the bottom row can't be negative. (As the common difference for the bottom row gets larger, so does the common difference for the st and rd column, making the bigger, and because the smallest answer is while the minimum value for negative numbers is , it can't be negative.) Now let's assume that all the numbers are 0. By just filling in the st and rd column, we find that it is:  which makes the . is not an answer choice, so the bottom row cannot be all 's. Now, we know that the bottom row must be positive. Here's where the bashing begins. Lucky for us, the numbers must all be integers, cutting down on the number of cases we need to test. Starting with the bottom row having a common difference of , we get  At this point we notice that the second row does not form an arithmetic progression, so we test out the next case, with the common difference being . We get  At this point we notice that the second row does not form an arithmetic progression, so we test out the next case, with the common difference being .

What is the area of triangle ?    First, we should find the length of . In order to do this, as we see in the diagram, it can be split into 4 equal sections. Since diagram shows us that it is made up of two triangles, then the triangle outlined in red must be a triangle, as , and the two lines are perpendicular (it is proveable, but during competition, it is best to assume this is true, as the diagram is draw pretty well to scale). Also, since we know the length of the longest side of the red triangle is , then the side we are looking for, which is outlined in blue, must be by the relationship of triangles. Therefore , which is the base of the triangle we are looking, for must be Now all we have to do is find the height. We can split the height into 2 sections, the green and the light green. The green section must be , as shows us. Also, the light green section must be equal to , as in the previous paragraph, the triangle outlined in red is . Then, the green section, which is the height, must be , which is just . Then the area of the triangle must be , which is just ~Solution by HappySharks ~Minor Edits by mathkiddus Let be quadrilateral . Drawing line splits the triangle into .\nDrawing the altitude from to point on line , we know is , is , and is .  Due to the many similarities present, we can find that is , and the height of is is and the height of is . Solving for the area of gives which is ~9897 (latex beginner here) ~i_am_suk_at_math(very minor latex edits) Let's start by looking at kite . We can quickly deduce based off of the side lengths that the kite can be split into two triangles. Going back to the triangle , focus on side . There are kites, they are all either reflected over the line or a line perpendicular to , meaning the length of can be split up into 4 equal parts. Pick out the bottom-left kite, and we can observe that the kite and the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and share a degree angle. (this was deduced from the triangles in the kite) The line AB and the right side of the kite are perpendicular, forming a angle. Because that is also a triangle with a hypotenuse of , so we find the length of AB to be , which is . Then, we can drop an altitude from to . We know that will be equivalent to the sum of the longer side of the kite and the shorter side of the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and . (Look at the line formed on the left of that drops down to if you are confused) We already have those values from the triangles, so we can just plug it into the triangle area formula, .

Let the left kite with as a vertex touch the kite with as vertex at point . is a so and . So, and , and the area is ~Mintylemon66 As stated in the solutions above we can easily find that is split into equal parts, so we have We can calculate by using similarity to find is a triangle, therefore we have and finally therefore Similarly we have is congruent to therefore Next we have is congruent to telling us Noticing is right, we apply Pythagorean theorem to to find Next we would like to calculate CJ, As said before so We know the inscribed angle between CG and GJ is and finally we know So we apply LoC on triangle CGJ in order to find CJ. Now since we have all side lengths of we can find Applying LoC again on we have, We can solve for the area using the sin area formula which is To find we use the well known fact So we find, Finally to wrap up we can find the area of using the sin area formula, Therefore our answer is ~ mathkiddus Assume we set A as . The line AB can be split into 4 equal sections, easily noticed in the picture. Not that the first equal section, starting at A. When we follow the line AB, we see that it's a right angle, noticing its a 30, 60, 90 triangle. Because the hypothenuse of that triangle is . Using the 30, 60, 90 ratio, we see that one of those equal sections is 3/2. Making the coordinate of B, . Now, we must find the coordinate of C. Note that when we drop C down to the perpindicular of AB, there is a component to C, and a component to C. To find the X component, we see that it's one equal section found before as 3/2, and another section equal to 1, given in the question, making it = 5/2. The Y component can be seen as another two sections. The two green sections marked in solution 1. One is due to the same 30 60 90 triangle we found in the first part of the solution. And the other part is , given in the question. Making = . \nSo we see that C = ( , ) Using shoelace theorem, we get to get sorry for no diagrams D: -marcus Alternate way to calculate area: Notice once you get the y-coordinate of C, you can realize it's just the height of the triangle.

Therefore, ~ luckuso , yuvag, Technodoggo (LaTeX credits to the latter two and editing to the latter)  \\begin{align*}\n(1) - (2) \\implies ab + c -bc - a &=(a-c)(b-1)=13 \\\\\n(2) - (3) \\implies bc + a -ca - b &=(b-a)(c-1)=27 \\\\\n(3) - (1) \\implies ca + b -ab - c &=(c-b)(a-1)=-40\n\\end{align*} There are ordered pairs of : , , . However, only the last ordered pair meets all three equations. Therefore, ~ luckuso , megaboy6679 (formatting), Technodoggo (LaTeX optimization/clarity adjustments) Before we start, keep in mind that the problem is asking for the sum \\(ab+bc+ac\\). This is nothing but \\(100+87+60-a-b-c\\), or \\(247-(a+b+c\\)). To solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination: Let's first check options A and B, since they only happen when a,b, and c sum to 35 or 0.\nWe begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, \\( (12, 8, 4) \\) satisfies \\( ab + c = 100 \\), but does not satisfy \\( bc + a = 87\\), or \\( ac + b = 60\\). If \\(a+b+c=0\\), then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work.\nFrom this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be \\( \\textbf{A} \\) or \\( \\textbf{B} \\). Now let's test the next option, option C.\nOption \\( \\textbf{C} \\) states \\( ab + bc + ca = 258 \\). If true, then: \\(a + b + c = -11\\) This sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing \\( (-4, -5, -2) \\) confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option \\( \\textbf{C} \\). Finally, let's test the last two options: D and E.\nFor option \\( \\textbf{E} \\), the sum \\( a + b + c \\) would be: \\(247 - 284 = -37\\) Testing values such as \\( (-11, -12, -14) \\), the resulting sums \\( ab + c \\), \\( bc + a \\), and \\( ac + b \\) are far too large to satisfy the equation.  \nTherefore, \\( \\textbf{E} \\) is also eliminated. Once we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers:\nFinally, we test option \\( \\textbf{D} \\). Using \\( ab + bc + ca = 276 \\), we get that \\(a+b+c = -29\\). Also note that a, b, and c all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of a, b, and c such that they are all different, and the sum \\(a+b+c = -29\\). The values \\( (-9, -12, -8) \\) are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations.\nSo, the correct answer is: ~pimathmonkey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYzBhf3Ke0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://youtu.be/1JyBt8Bh_vI The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

Suppose the bee occupies the point If the die shows , then the bee moves to the point and if the die shows then the bee moves to the point Analogous moves are made with the other four outcomes. Suppose the bee starts at the point and the die is rolled four times. What is the probability that the bee traverses four distinct edges of some unit cube?   ~ Diagram by PaperMath  ~ Solution diagram by juwushu WLOG, assume that the first two moves are equal for all possible combinations, since the direction does not matter. The first move has a probability of being along one of the unit cubes around the origin, and the second move has a chance.\nNow, there are two cases. We are currently on one of the points of the by squares that are aligned with the axes.\nThe first case is if the bee moves to the corner of a cube farthest away from the origin.\nHere, there is a chance of this happening and a chance of the fourth move remaining on one of the cubes.\nThe second case is if the bee moves along the same plane of the by squares previously, ending up on a point 1 away from the origin. There is a chance of this happening and a chance of remaining on one of the cubes.\nNow, multiply and sum for the answer. Evaluating this gives you the answer of .\nSolution by juwushu .\nMinor edits by andliu766 Remove the dice. It is not necessary for this problem. It is the same problem if you instead view this problem as the bee moving one up or down in the and directions. Count the total number of ways for one cube of the 8 total ones. It is not hard to see that after the first step (which you can travel to or -  3 ways), you have a total of 8 moves to traverse a face of that 1x1 cube. Hence, for each cube, you would have total moves. There are a total of 8 cubes you could have traversed, though, so multiplying this by yields We have to account for overcounting. For example, when we traversed the face in the plane the number of ways that we traverse that particular face got counted twice, once from the cube in the far upper right and once from the cube in the closer upper right. For a given face, you can go clockwise or counterclockwise, hence yielding ways. There are a total of shared faces, each one shared by exactly two faces so no additonal PIE is needed. We simply subtract from our original count now, yielding With no restrictions, there are a total of ways to move four steps.

        "problem_statement": "The figure below shows a dotted grid cells wide and cells tall consisting of squares. Carl places -inch toothpicks along some of the sides of the squares to create a closed loop that does not intersect itself. The numbers in the cells indicate the number of sides of that square that are to be covered by toothpicks, and any number of toothpicks are allowed if no number is written. In how many ways can Carl place the toothpicks? Observations: 1. You can not have a vertical line in any place other than the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. 2. You can place a box around the top row or along the bottom row, otherwise all the solutions have a vertical line at the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. Thus, Using casework, we can split this problem into 4 cases. However, we can focus on only the first one for right now. For case 1, we assume that the green lines shown below are given (always have toothpicks on them)   And the only toothpicks we can place that will connect to the red lines are to go horizontally inward:  Now, concentrate on the first row of squares. A toothpick can be placed on either the bottom or top and connected to a continuous squiggle by adding vertical toothpicks, for example,  How many squiggles are possible?  We can summarize this by giving a high squiggle position a 1 and a low position a 0, thus we have a 6-digit binary sequence. Thus, we can have ways to make this squiggle. Case 2: We can also, as the observations state, pull in one of the sides, thus we can have a squiggle with 5 binary digits. only utilizing the first 7 columns:  Here, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 3: Similarly, we can utilize the last 7 columns.  Again, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 4: We can use an even smaller section. Using only the middle 6 columns gives us a 4-wide squiggle:  Thus, there are ways to make this squiggle. Adding up all our cases: However, there are two more ways to draw a qualifying shape:  We can draw a rectangle like that in the first row or third row. Thus, we have a grand total of ways. A note to (potential) editors:\nThis answer was not made to be concise or especially professional. It was made to explicitly explain this problem in a way so that it is easy to understand and follow. ~hermanboxcar5 Notes:\nRemember these are the ONLY possible cases. It is impossible to cross through the rows of boxes of ones to connect the loop around the bottom since then the loop would intersect itself if you are to put only one toothpick on each box with a one (a more clear definition of Observation 1).\nYou are not undercounting by only counting the binary digits on the top, because all of the digits on one side will have corresponding opposite digits on the other. ~juwushu Notice that for any case where the closed loop does not connect from the top side of the ones and bottom side of the ones, there are two of these cases. A cheese solution can be found from this; noting that B and C are the only two options to each other, and, being two apart, with people likely to forget this case, is likely to be the correct answer.\nCheese solution done by juwushu . We have cases where the loop does not go through the middle. If the loop goes through the middle, we must have a full column on Then we have empty middle squares. For each one we can have one on top or one on bottom, so Notice that for each case of fixed toothpicks, there is only one way to form the loop.

We square, rearrange, and apply the difference of squares formula to the given equation: It is clear that so Each ordered pair gives one ordered pair so there are such ordered pairs Remark From we get respectively. ~MRENTHUSIASM Squaring both sides of the given equation gives Splitting into its factors (keep in mind it doesn't ask for positive integers, so the factors can be double negative, too) gives six cases:      . Note that the square root in the problem doesn't have with it. Therefore, if there are two solutions, and , then these together are to be counted as one solution.\nThe solutions expressed as are:      . and are to be counted as one, same for and . Therefore, the solution is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 From looking at the problem, it's obvious that are already solutions. From squaring and rearranging, we get We know that the difference between two consecutive squares is always odd, and for each pair of increasing consecutive squares, the difference starts from and increases by each time. This means that there is an existing pair, of consecutive squares that will satisfy this equation. Also note that the answer cannot be infinity because the difference between two squares will increase as the two squares get higher, consecutive or not. Therefore, the solutions and where and are consecutive that have a square difference of , give the answer of ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Minor Note: Looking at the problem, it is obvious of -7 and 7 as solutions and you can eliminate 1,3,and infinite. You can assume that there is more than 2 solutions because when determining square expressions, these problems usually always have more than an obvious solution.\n~breakingbread Clearly, and are solutions.\nNotice that . Remembering our Pythagorean triples, we realize is a solution as well, and by extension, so is . Since 7 is not part of any other Pythagorean triple, we can conclude the answer is .\n~i_am_suk_at_math_2 Since in there are no restrictions of the sign of , we know that the solution will come in pairs, with negative and positive . Therefore, the answer will not be or . We can further confirm that it is not , since the problem would probably ask for an operation of and instead of the number of solutions. We can also guess it is not , since then the problem would ask for the sum of one of the variables in the solutions. It seems improbable that over the integers there would be infinite answers. So the answer is ~megaboy6679 (do not ever use this) Rearranging the equation gives  This is a classic Pythagorean Theorem equation, where is a leg and and are the two remaining legs. All we have to do is to find triples that satisfy this equation. It is common knowledge that is a triple, thus and are two solutions. Another one is , so and are two other solutions. We can be sure that there are no other triples to find because is the highest answer choice, otherwise it would be \"infinitely many\", which isn't plausible.

In total, transformation pairs commute. ~xHypotenuse Alright so realize that obviously rotation and dilation are commute, if you ever looked at the polar plane. Also, reflecting around the x-axis means that moving to the right two units and dilating are commute. You can easily see this by taking an arbitrary point and applying the transformations.

However, since the area in this configuration is simply we can infer that the problem is talking about the configuration in Solution 1. ~dbnl Since this problem involves equilateral triangles, the only possible number under the square root is . Now subtracting all of the answer choices by , we get: Due to the even parity of the problem, we can safely assume that the answer is either or , but as is a multiple of and , we get the answer of . ~megaboy6679 (pardon the diagrams :D) say the area we want to find is x. since the equilateral triangle has an internal angle of 60, the exterior angle formed by the triangle and the line is 120. simplifying the diagram you will get: make three of these that each circle is tangent to the other 2 circles Since they are 3 congruent triangles, you can make an equilateral triangle using their radius(12), with each vertex at the center of each circle. This will make an equilateral triangle of side length 24. if you look now, the area within the equilateral triangle consists of 3 of a circle, and 3 of x. we first find the area of the triangle, which is , we then find the area of of a circle, which is , we subtract by , and divide by 3, yielding the area of x. _________________________________________ = is which is ~Yiguo Zhang https://youtu.be/rIF5L_-zZYQ https://youtu.be/ABkKz0gS1MU?si=ZQBgDMRaJmMPSSMM https://youtu.be/oCQ_QvXqV5s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzXBMltyXjs&t=53s The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

What is length ?   Using the rectangle with area , let its short side be and the long side be . Observe that for every rectangle, since ratios of the side length of the rectangles are directly proportional to the ratios of the square roots of the areas (For example, each side of the rectangle with area is times that of the rectangle with area ), as they are all similar to each other. The side opposite on the large rectangle is hence written as . However, can be written as . Since the two lengths are equal, we can write , or . Therefore, we can write .

Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for , where itself and are factors of . From here, we can check whether yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of , which is . , this doesn't have an integer root either. So, then we check the next biggest factor which is , , which we get as a root. This means the common ration is . We then multiply times and add up the digits getting . ~yuvag Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be , with . This means that and must both be integers, therefore and are both factors of .

This means that there will be or whole loops in the subset implying that there will be elements in S. However, we have undercounted, as we did not count the remainder that resulted from With a remainder of we can fit more elements into the subset namely and resulting in a total of or elements in subset . NOTE: To prove that this is the best we can do, consider adding each element one by one, for the first element, say n. If n is greater than 2, we can choose n - 2 which is always better. Therefore, n = 1 or n = 2. If n = 2 was optimal, then choose it, then the set of usable numbers in becomes 5 through 2024. We can transform the usable set of to where contains the numbers 1 through 2020. Because we assumed n = 2 was optimal, we can choose n = 2 for the set too. Because every element in is 4 below the elements of , choosing 2 in would mean choosing 6 in set . By induction we see that our list would be {2,6,10,14,18,.....2022} which only gives 506 elements which is sub-optimal. Therefore, we can conclude that n = 1 is optimal, and we proceed as the solution above. -weihou0 Notice that we can first place odd numbers, then place even numbers between each pair. We can start at and continue from there. Realize that the smallest number such that reproduces odd number is . The next ones are . We can proceed to find the number of numbers in this particular sequence. From the equation , we get that works, so this means there is 253 solutions. Looking at we can see that there could only be 1 possible number between each pair, yielding . Then see that we can fit two more into the number count since the set to can fit two evens. Now this means and don’t work. Now test out . Using the same method, we get that is the maximum number in the set. Everything above doesn’t work, as we can split it down into smaller subgroups, so the answer is . ~EaZ_Shadow  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ0SBMqeAfg https://youtu.be/fW7OGWee31c?si=oq7toGPh2QaksLHE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

What number is in position https://youtu.be/bA95oaAbEbY Start from the . Going up, let the common difference be , and going left, let the common difference be . Therefore, we have Looking at the third column, we can see that the common difference going up is . We fill this in: Looking at the second row, has two values beside it, so we can write and we can do the same with the third row, which gives Now we have the system of equations and solving it gives , therefore we can now fill in the grid with actual numbers. But before doing that, note that we're only looking for a value in the first row, and because we already have two known values in that row, we can find the common difference for that row and not focus on anything else. Focusing only on the first row yields This means that the common difference from right to left is . Therefore, the desired value is ~Tacos_are_yummy_1 Assume the number in position is . Then, the integer in position will be , since and average out to x. (They form an arithmetic sequence). Similarly, the integer in position is , and the integer in position is . This means the number is in position (1, 2). The only answer choice that makes an integer is ~ElaineGu Let's look at the bottom-left corner. There can be possible cases for the bottom row. Either the numbers are negative, all , or positive. Let's assume all the numbers are negative. We know that the numbers in between the will be large, so we want to minimize it, because the largest answer choice is only .  To fill in the st and rd column, we simply find the common differences. We get:  Finding the , we notice that it is , which is bigger than any of the other answer choices, so the bottom row can't be negative. (As the common difference for the bottom row gets larger, so does the common difference for the st and rd column, making the bigger, and because the smallest answer is while the minimum value for negative numbers is , it can't be negative.) Now let's assume that all the numbers are 0. By just filling in the st and rd column, we find that it is:  which makes the . is not an answer choice, so the bottom row cannot be all 's. Now, we know that the bottom row must be positive. Here's where the bashing begins. Lucky for us, the numbers must all be integers, cutting down on the number of cases we need to test. Starting with the bottom row having a common difference of , we get  At this point we notice that the second row does not form an arithmetic progression, so we test out the next case, with the common difference being . We get  At this point we notice that the second row does not form an arithmetic progression, so we test out the next case, with the common difference being . We get  , giving us the answer ~ YTH\n~Astingo for submission and final array Let the bottom row of the grid have arithmetic difference . Then the matrix becomes Using the middle column, we have the middle item equal to . Filling in the middle row (which has a common difference of ) The arithmetic sequence in the 4th column (2nd from the right) then has a common difference of , so we From the cell in the 4th column, 5th row we have , or .

What is the area of triangle ?    First, we should find the length of . In order to do this, as we see in the diagram, it can be split into 4 equal sections. Since diagram shows us that it is made up of two triangles, then the triangle outlined in red must be a triangle, as , and the two lines are perpendicular (it is proveable, but during competition, it is best to assume this is true, as the diagram is draw pretty well to scale). Also, since we know the length of the longest side of the red triangle is , then the side we are looking for, which is outlined in blue, must be by the relationship of triangles. Therefore , which is the base of the triangle we are looking, for must be Now all we have to do is find the height. We can split the height into 2 sections, the green and the light green. The green section must be , as shows us. Also, the light green section must be equal to , as in the previous paragraph, the triangle outlined in red is . Then, the green section, which is the height, must be , which is just . Then the area of the triangle must be , which is just ~Solution by HappySharks ~Minor Edits by mathkiddus Let be quadrilateral . Drawing line splits the triangle into .\nDrawing the altitude from to point on line , we know is , is , and is .

Solving for the area of gives which is ~9897 (latex beginner here) ~i_am_suk_at_math(very minor latex edits) Let's start by looking at kite . We can quickly deduce based off of the side lengths that the kite can be split into two triangles. Going back to the triangle , focus on side . There are kites, they are all either reflected over the line or a line perpendicular to , meaning the length of can be split up into 4 equal parts. Pick out the bottom-left kite, and we can observe that the kite and the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and share a degree angle. (this was deduced from the triangles in the kite) The line AB and the right side of the kite are perpendicular, forming a angle. Because that is also a triangle with a hypotenuse of , so we find the length of AB to be , which is . Then, we can drop an altitude from to . We know that will be equivalent to the sum of the longer side of the kite and the shorter side of the triangle formed by the intersection of the kite and . (Look at the line formed on the left of that drops down to if you are confused) We already have those values from the triangles, so we can just plug it into the triangle area formula, .

Let the left kite with as a vertex touch the kite with as vertex at point . is a so and . So, and , and the area is ~Mintylemon66 As stated in the solutions above we can easily find that is split into equal parts, so we have We can calculate by using similarity to find is a triangle, therefore we have and finally therefore Similarly we have is congruent to therefore Next we have is congruent to telling us Noticing is right, we apply Pythagorean theorem to to find Next we would like to calculate CJ, As said before so We know the inscribed angle between CG and GJ is and finally we know So we apply LoC on triangle CGJ in order to find CJ. Now since we have all side lengths of we can find Applying LoC again on we have, We can solve for the area using the sin area formula which is To find we use the well known fact So we find, Finally to wrap up we can find the area of using the sin area formula, Therefore our answer is ~ mathkiddus Assume we set A as . The line AB can be split into 4 equal sections, easily noticed in the picture. Not that the first equal section, starting at A. When we follow the line AB, we see that it's a right angle, noticing its a 30, 60, 90 triangle. Because the hypothenuse of that triangle is . Using the 30, 60, 90 ratio, we see that one of those equal sections is 3/2. Making the coordinate of B, . Now, we must find the coordinate of C. Note that when we drop C down to the perpindicular of AB, there is a component to C, and a component to C. To find the X component, we see that it's one equal section found before as 3/2, and another section equal to 1, given in the question, making it = 5/2. The Y component can be seen as another two sections. The two green sections marked in solution 1. One is due to the same 30 60 90 triangle we found in the first part of the solution. And the other part is , given in the question. Making = . \nSo we see that C = ( , ) Using shoelace theorem, we get to get sorry for no diagrams D: -marcus Alternate way to calculate area: Notice once you get the y-coordinate of C, you can realize it's just the height of the triangle. So the area would be times base times height where the base is and the height is .\n~ilikemath247365 The figure made of kites was in fact, an Einstein tile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxC_UENbmNk https://youtu.be/hcpej1uRYu4?si=-DekbEWkAg_c6nsg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhC58BB3kJA ~i_am_suk_at_math_2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjdLNjiO5Qw The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

However, only the last ordered pair meets all three equations. Therefore, ~ luckuso , megaboy6679 (formatting), Technodoggo (LaTeX optimization/clarity adjustments) Before we start, keep in mind that the problem is asking for the sum \\(ab+bc+ac\\). This is nothing but \\(100+87+60-a-b-c\\), or \\(247-(a+b+c\\)). To solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination: Let's first check options A and B, since they only happen when a,b, and c sum to 35 or 0.\nWe begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, \\( (12, 8, 4) \\) satisfies \\( ab + c = 100 \\), but does not satisfy \\( bc + a = 87\\), or \\( ac + b = 60\\). If \\(a+b+c=0\\), then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work.\nFrom this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be \\( \\textbf{A} \\) or \\( \\textbf{B} \\). Now let's test the next option, option C.\nOption \\( \\textbf{C} \\) states \\( ab + bc + ca = 258 \\). If true, then: \\(a + b + c = -11\\) This sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing \\( (-4, -5, -2) \\) confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option \\( \\textbf{C} \\). Finally, let's test the last two options: D and E.\nFor option \\( \\textbf{E} \\), the sum \\( a + b + c \\) would be: \\(247 - 284 = -37\\) Testing values such as \\( (-11, -12, -14) \\), the resulting sums \\( ab + c \\), \\( bc + a \\), and \\( ac + b \\) are far too large to satisfy the equation.  \nTherefore, \\( \\textbf{E} \\) is also eliminated. Once we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers:\nFinally, we test option \\( \\textbf{D} \\). Using \\( ab + bc + ca = 276 \\), we get that \\(a+b+c = -29\\). Also note that a, b, and c all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of a, b, and c such that they are all different, and the sum \\(a+b+c = -29\\). The values \\( (-9, -12, -8) \\) are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations.\nSo, the correct answer is: ~pimathmonkey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYzBhf3Ke0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQ74nt3ynw https://youtu.be/1JyBt8Bh_vI The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .",

Suppose the bee occupies the point If the die shows , then the bee moves to the point and if the die shows then the bee moves to the point Analogous moves are made with the other four outcomes. Suppose the bee starts at the point and the die is rolled four times. What is the probability that the bee traverses four distinct edges of some unit cube?   ~ Diagram by PaperMath  ~ Solution diagram by juwushu WLOG, assume that the first two moves are equal for all possible combinations, since the direction does not matter. The first move has a probability of being along one of the unit cubes around the origin, and the second move has a chance.\nNow, there are two cases. We are currently on one of the points of the by squares that are aligned with the axes.\nThe first case is if the bee moves to the corner of a cube farthest away from the origin.\nHere, there is a chance of this happening and a chance of the fourth move remaining on one of the cubes.\nThe second case is if the bee moves along the same plane of the by squares previously, ending up on a point 1 away from the origin. There is a chance of this happening and a chance of remaining on one of the cubes.\nNow, multiply and sum for the answer. Evaluating this gives you the answer of .\nSolution by juwushu .\nMinor edits by andliu766 Remove the dice. It is not necessary for this problem. It is the same problem if you instead view this problem as the bee moving one up or down in the and directions. Count the total number of ways for one cube of the 8 total ones. It is not hard to see that after the first step (which you can travel to or -  3 ways), you have a total of 8 moves to traverse a face of that 1x1 cube. Hence, for each cube, you would have total moves. There are a total of 8 cubes you could have traversed, though, so multiplying this by yields We have to account for overcounting. For example, when we traversed the face in the plane the number of ways that we traverse that particular face got counted twice, once from the cube in the far upper right and once from the cube in the closer upper right. For a given face, you can go clockwise or counterclockwise, hence yielding ways. There are a total of shared faces, each one shared by exactly two faces so no additonal PIE is needed. We simply subtract from our original count now, yielding With no restrictions, there are a total of ways to move four steps.

        "problem_statement": "The figure below shows a dotted grid cells wide and cells tall consisting of squares. Carl places -inch toothpicks along some of the sides of the squares to create a closed loop that does not intersect itself. The numbers in the cells indicate the number of sides of that square that are to be covered by toothpicks, and any number of toothpicks are allowed if no number is written. In how many ways can Carl place the toothpicks? Observations: 1. You can not have a vertical line in any place other than the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. 2. You can place a box around the top row or along the bottom row, otherwise all the solutions have a vertical line at the first and second columns and the last and second-to-last columns. Thus, Using casework, we can split this problem into 4 cases. However, we can focus on only the first one for right now. For case 1, we assume that the green lines shown below are given (always have toothpicks on them)   And the only toothpicks we can place that will connect to the red lines are to go horizontally inward:  Now, concentrate on the first row of squares. A toothpick can be placed on either the bottom or top and connected to a continuous squiggle by adding vertical toothpicks, for example,  How many squiggles are possible?  We can summarize this by giving a high squiggle position a 1 and a low position a 0, thus we have a 6-digit binary sequence. Thus, we can have ways to make this squiggle. Case 2: We can also, as the observations state, pull in one of the sides, thus we can have a squiggle with 5 binary digits. only utilizing the first 7 columns:  Here, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 3: Similarly, we can utilize the last 7 columns.  Again, we only have 5 binary digits to work with, so there are ways to make this squiggle. Case 4: We can use an even smaller section. Using only the middle 6 columns gives us a 4-wide squiggle:  Thus, there are ways to make this squiggle. Adding up all our cases: However, there are two more ways to draw a qualifying shape:  We can draw a rectangle like that in the first row or third row. Thus, we have a grand total of ways. A note to (potential) editors:\nThis answer was not made to be concise or especially professional. It was made to explicitly explain this problem in a way so that it is easy to understand and follow. ~hermanboxcar5 Notes:\nRemember these are the ONLY possible cases. It is impossible to cross through the rows of boxes of ones to connect the loop around the bottom since then the loop would intersect itself if you are to put only one toothpick on each box with a one (a more clear definition of Observation 1).\nYou are not undercounting by only counting the binary digits on the top, because all of the digits on one side will have corresponding opposite digits on the other. ~juwushu Notice that for any case where the closed loop does not connect from the top side of the ones and bottom side of the ones, there are two of these cases. A cheese solution can be found from this; noting that B and C are the only two options to each other, and, being two apart, with people likely to forget this case, is likely to be the correct answer.\nCheese solution done by juwushu . We have cases where the loop does not go through the middle. If the loop goes through the middle, we must have a full column on Then we have empty middle squares. For each one we can have one on top or one on bottom, so Notice that for each case of fixed toothpicks, there is only one way to form the loop.
